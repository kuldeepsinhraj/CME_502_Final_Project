Required Modules:

openpyxl
numpy
scipy
matplotlib

Notes on experiments:
The R^2 will be very similar for all the experiments for the different orders. This is most likely because the concentrations used were of
the order of 10^-6 M. It is possible that this may interfere with rate determination and thus is it recommended that concentration of higher
order be used with the program.
